Nostalgic J2ME runtime enviroment/emulator

I used to run opera mini in my system
It was good as it was a J2me runtime enviroment
This was meant to run the jar/jad files which was once popular during NOKIA days 
I still own some of the devices but have passed it down 
Like how apk file is now for Android,jar/jad was for installing apps games in J2ME phones which now will be considered as basic or dump phone 


This is a copy of https://code.google.com/archive/p/microemu/downloads


as I think the original developer has abandoned it as smart phone/smart devices are the norm.
People having JAVA knowledge and developing J2ME enviroment must have switch to new platforms
like ANDROID STUDIO,JAVA main,KOTLIN,FLUTTER 

Most would have got upsilled to basically able to develop in ANDROID STUDIO in java OR KOTLIN,
USING cross apps like nodejs,FLUTTER,CORDOVA,GO etc


Whatever it might be,the app still works and there are jar/jad files still availbe online
